    Search engine optimization is a huge topic. 
    This article isnâ€™t the place for a deep dive, but SEO best practices are something any content producer should study. Here are a few bare-bones basics.

Titles will make or break you. A good title with competitive (but not too competitive) keywords is key to getting your article seen, read, and shared.
Structure is crucial. The Internet has made us into scanners rather than deep readers. Your article needs to be skimmable. Not only that, but subheaders are important for placing SEO-friendly keywords.
You should link back to yourself. Linking back to your own relevant articles is a great way to generate more pageviews.
Fresh content is critical. Keep your articles updated. That includes creating fresh new stories and updating older ones.
